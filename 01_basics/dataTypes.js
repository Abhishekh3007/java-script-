//alert(3 + 3); //error because we are using node and syntax is not this

console.log(3 + 3); //redablity of code is most important as is this line is telling that it is adding and displaying

console.log("abhishek");
console.log("abhi"); //this is wrong practise of writing the code as its not readable it will run but prefer not writing the code like this

//premitive 
let name="abhishek";//as its bounded into double qoutes it would be iedentified as string
console.log(typeof "name");//typeof is used to check the datatype 
let age=22;//now its an number or int data type
let isLoggedIn=false;//boolean value either true or false

//number => 2 power 53 is the space adress alocated to the number or intger data type
//bigint => mostly used in big sites or huge number type ex facebook stock market
//string=""
//null=> its is an stand alone value most important 
//undefined => its an  variable which not defined just initialized and not asigned anything
let state;//undefined output
console.log(state);
let  temprature=null; //null output
console.log(temprature);

//symbol=> to identified unique as in react you build multiple componets you can identify uniqely

//object 
console.log(typeof null);//output is object null is an standalone value 
console.log(typeof undefined);//output is undefined its an type
